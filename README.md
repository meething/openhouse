#### Status
- Alpha Flight! Open an `issue` and join us hack this together!

#### Credits
- powered by [GUN](https://gun.eco) and [MeeThing](https://meething.space)
- UI baseline by [nickgarfield](https://github.com/nickgarfield)

##### Design Notes
- p2p audio only + screensharing _(no video by design)_
- uses **GUN DAM** (Daisy-chain Ad-hoc Mesh-network) for signaling
- uses **Meething** GUN bootstrap services _(no data!)_ and room state
- not for large groups _(yet!)_
